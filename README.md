# sfml_testing
- Simple project creating different objects to be displayed.
- Analog Clock GUI class creates a drawing of analog clock in real time. Size, position and color are set at initialization.

Goals Moving Forward:
1. Implement a "game map" to make projects with a grid of tiles (pathfinding, games, etc)
2. Continue learning OpenGL alongside SFML and eventually go towards 3D
3. Finally, create a "smart" traffic light simulator with learned concepts
